## Additional notes:

### Basic Rule

"Where were we" is a question asking about location or progress in a conversation/task. "Where we were" is a statement or part of a dependent clause. The key is understanding when you need question word order (inversion) versus statement word order.

### When to Use "Where were we" (Question)

Use inverted word order (were + we) when asking a direct question:

- Where were we in the discussion?
- Where were we before the interruption?
- Where were we on page 5?
- So, where were we? (resuming conversation)

### When to Use "Where we were" (Statement/Clause)

Use normal word order (we + were) in statements or as part of a larger sentence:

- I remember where we were in the book.
- Can you show me where we were on the map?
- That's where we were yesterday.
- Do you know where we were when it happened?

### Common Mistakes

#### ❌ Incorrect:

- Where we were in our meeting? (missing inversion in direct question)
- I forgot where were we. (incorrect inversion in indirect question)
- Tell me where were we discussing. (incorrect inversion after "tell me")

#### ✓ Correct:

- Where were we in our meeting?
- I forgot where we were.
- Tell me where we were discussing this.

### Quick Test

**Ask yourself:** Is this a direct question standing alone?

- **Yes** → Use inversion: "Where were we?"
- **No** (it follows another verb like "know," "remember," "forgot") → No inversion: "where we were"

### Special Case: "Where were we" as Phrase

"Where were we?" is commonly used as a set phrase meaning "let's continue from where we stopped":

- Okay, where were we? (resuming after interruption)
- Right, where were we before the phone rang?

### Example Transformations

- Where we were discussing the budget? → Where were we discussing the budget?
- I don't recall where were we. → I don't recall where we were.
- Can you remind me where we were? → ✓ (already correct)

### Similar Patterns

This rule applies to other question words too:

- What were you doing? / I know what you were doing.
- Who was he? / I wonder who he was.
- When were they arriving? / She asked when they were arriving.

**Remember:** Direct questions need inversion (were we), but clauses after verbs like "know," "remember," or "forgot" use normal word order (we were).
