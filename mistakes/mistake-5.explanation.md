# Explanation: Other vs Another

## The Rule

**"Another"** = an + other (used for singular countable nouns)
**"Other"** = used for plural countable nouns or before "one/ones"

## When to use "Another"

Use **"another"** before a **singular countable noun**:
- I need another book.
- Can I have another chance?
- Let's try another way.

Think of it as: "I need **an other** book" → "I need **another** book"

## When to use "Other"

Use **"other"** before **plural nouns**:
- I need other books. (plural)
- There are other options. (plural)
- I have other friends. (plural)

Use **"other"** before "one" or "ones":
- I need the other one.
- These shoes don't fit; show me the other ones.

## Common Mistakes

❌ I need other book. (incorrect - "book" is singular)
✅ I need another book.

❌ Can you give me other example? (incorrect - "example" is singular)
✅ Can you give me another example?

❌ I want to try another things. (incorrect - "things" is plural)
✅ I want to try other things.

## Quick Test

If you can say "**a**" or "**an**" before the noun, use "**another**".
- a book → another book ✅
- a example → an example → another example ✅

If the noun is plural, use "**other**":
- books (no "a") → other books ✅
- examples (no "a") → other examples ✅

## Summary

- **Another** = singular noun (another book, another day)
- **Other** = plural noun (other books, other days)
- **The other** = specific reference (the other book, the other day)
