# Explanation: Which vs That

## The Rule

In **defining (restrictive) clauses** - clauses that are essential to identify what you're talking about - use **"that"** in American English.

In **non-defining (non-restrictive) clauses** - clauses that add extra information but aren't essential - use **"which"** with commas.

## Examples

**Defining clauses (use "that"):**
- The book **that** I'm reading is fascinating. (Essential: tells us which book)
- I want the car **that** has the best mileage. (Essential: specifies which car)

**Non-defining clauses (use "which" with commas):**
- My new phone, **which** cost $800, has an amazing camera. (Extra info: not essential)
- The report, **which** took me three days to write, was well received. (Extra info)

## Simple Test

Ask yourself: "Is this information essential to identify what I'm talking about?"
- **Yes** → Use "that" (no commas)
- **No** → Use "which" (with commas)

## Note

British English is more flexible and often uses "which" for both types of clauses. However, American English strongly prefers "that" for defining clauses. Using "that" is never wrong, so when in doubt, use "that" for essential information!
