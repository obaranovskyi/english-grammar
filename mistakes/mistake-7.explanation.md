# Subject-Verb Agreement with Auxiliary Verbs (Do/Does) in Questions

## The Mistake
Using "is/are" instead of "do/does" when forming questions about actions, or forgetting to use an auxiliary verb entirely.

## The Rule
To form yes/no questions about actions (verbs), you must use:
- **Do** with plural subjects (and I, you, we, they)
- **Does** with singular subjects (he, she, it, and singular nouns)

You **cannot** use "is/are" with action verbs in questions, and you **cannot** form questions by just adding a question mark to a statement.

## Examples

### Correct ✓
- **Do** the backend requests work?
- **Does** the backend request work?
- **Do** these features work properly?
- **Does** this feature work properly?
- **Do** the servers respond?
- **Does** the server respond?

### Incorrect ✗
- **Is** the backend requests work? ✗ (cannot use "is" with action verb "work")
- The backend requests work? ✗ (missing auxiliary verb "do")
- **Are** the backend requests work? ✗ (cannot use "are" with action verb "work")
- **Is** the API working? ✓ (but this is present continuous, different meaning)

## Why These Are Wrong

1. **"Is the backend requests work?"** - You cannot use "is/are" with action verbs like "work" in simple present questions. You need "do/does".

2. **"The backend requests work?"** - In English, you cannot form questions by just adding a question mark. You must use an auxiliary verb (do/does) and invert the word order.

## Quick Tip
For questions about actions in simple present tense:
- Statement: "The requests work."
- Question: "**Do** the requests work?" (add "do" and keep the base verb)
- NOT: "Are the requests work?" or "The requests work?"
