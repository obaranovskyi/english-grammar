# Mistake 3

Error:

- What might be not the best option?

Correct version:

- What might not be the best option?

## Additional Notes

When using modal verbs (might, could, should, would, etc.) with negation, the word "not" should come immediately after the modal verb, not after the main verb "be."

### Structure:

**Modal verb + not + main verb**

### More Examples:

**Incorrect:**

- This place isn't big enough for the two of us. ❌ (if using "enough big")
- She may be not ready yet. ❌
- They could be not interested. ❌
- You should be not worried. ❌

**Correct:**

- This place isn't big enough for the two of us. ✓
- She may not be ready yet. ✓
- They could not be interested. ✓
- You should not be worried. ✓

### Contractions:

- might not (no contraction available)
- could not = couldn't
- should not = shouldn't
- would not = wouldn't

Remember: The negative word always goes directly after the modal verb, before any other verbs in the sentence.
