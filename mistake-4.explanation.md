## Additional notes:

### Basic Rule

When a question is embedded inside another sentence (after verbs like "explain," "tell," "know," "wonder," "ask"), use statement word order, NOT question word order. This means no inversion of subject and verb.

### Direct Question vs Embedded Question

#### Direct Question (standalone)

Uses question word order: **question word + auxiliary verb + subject + main verb**

- How can I use this?
- What should I do?
- Where are you going?
- When will they arrive?

#### Embedded Question (part of a sentence)

Uses statement word order: **question word + subject + auxiliary verb + main verb**

- Can you explain how I can use this?
- I don't know what I should do.
- Tell me where you are going.
- I wonder when they will arrive.

### Common Verbs Followed by Embedded Questions

These verbs typically introduce embedded questions:

- **explain:** Explain how it works.
- **tell:** Tell me what you need.
- **know:** I know where she lives.
- **wonder:** I wonder why he's late.
- **ask:** She asked when we would arrive.
- **understand:** I understand what you mean.
- **remember:** Do you remember where we parked?
- **show:** Show me how you did it.
- **see:** Let's see what happens.
- **decide:** We need to decide which option is best.

### Structure Comparison

| Direct Question       | Embedded Question                  |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Where is the station? | Do you know where the station is?  |
| What does this mean?  | Can you explain what this means?   |
| How do you do it?     | Show me how you do it.             |
| When will she arrive? | I don't know when she will arrive. |
| Why did he leave?     | I wonder why he left.              |
| Who is calling?       | Do you know who is calling?        |

### Common Mistakes

#### ❌ Incorrect:

- I don't understand why is this important.
- Can you tell me where did you buy it?
- I forgot what was his name.
- Do you know when will the meeting start?
- Please explain how does this work.

#### ✓ Correct:

- I don't understand why this is important.
- Can you tell me where you bought it?
- I forgot what his name was.
- Do you know when the meeting will start?
- Please explain how this works.

### Special Case: "Who" and "What" as Subject

When "who" or "what" is the subject of the embedded question, the word order looks the same as a direct question because there's no auxiliary verb to move:

- Who called? → I don't know who called. (same word order)
- What happened? → Tell me what happened. (same word order)
- Which option works best? → I wonder which option works best. (same word order)

### Quick Test

**Ask yourself:** Is this question standing alone or part of a larger sentence?

- **Standalone** → Use question word order: "How can I help?"
- **Part of a sentence** → Use statement word order: "Tell me how I can help."

### Example Transformations

- I wonder where did she go. → I wonder where she went.
- Do you know what time does it start? → Do you know what time it starts?
- Can you explain why is this happening? → Can you explain why this is happening?
- I don't remember when did we meet. → I don't remember when we met.

### Pronunciation Note

Embedded questions typically don't have rising intonation at the end, unlike direct questions:

- Direct: "Where are you going?" ↗ (rising)
- Embedded: "I don't know where you're going." → (falling)

**Remember:** When a question is embedded in a sentence, use normal statement word order (subject + verb), not inverted question word order (verb + subject).
