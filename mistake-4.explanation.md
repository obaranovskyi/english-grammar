## Additional notes:

### Basic Rule

The verb "explain" requires the preposition "to" before the indirect object (the person). You cannot say "explain me" - you must say "explain to me" or rearrange the sentence.

### Structure Options

#### 1. Explain + object + to + person

Most common structure

- Explain the rules to me.
- Can you explain this problem to her?
- He explained the situation to us.

#### 2. Explain + to + person + object

Alternative word order

- Explain to me the rules.
- Can you explain to her this problem?
- He explained to us the situation.

#### 3. Explain + object (without mentioning the person)

When the person is obvious from context

- Can you explain this?
- Let me explain the process.
- She explained everything clearly.

### Why This Mistake Happens

Many verbs can take two objects without "to":

- Tell me the answer ✓
- Show me the way ✓
- Give me the book ✓
- Teach me English ✓

But "explain" is different - it always needs "to" before the person:

- Explain to me the answer ✓
- Explain me the answer ❌

### Common Mistakes

#### ❌ Incorrect:

- Explain me the difference.
- Could you explain me why?
- She explained me the rules.
- Please explain me how it works.

#### ✓ Correct:

- Explain the difference to me.
- Could you explain to me why?
- She explained the rules to me.
- Please explain to me how it works.

### Similar Verbs That Need "to"

Other verbs that follow the same pattern:

- Describe to me (not "describe me")
- Suggest to me (not "suggest me")
- Announce to everyone (not "announce everyone")
- Prove to them (not "prove them")

### Quick Reference

| Incorrect          | Correct               |
| ------------------ | --------------------- |
| Explain me         | Explain to me         |
| Explain me it      | Explain it to me      |
| Can you explain me | Can you explain to me |
| He explained me    | He explained to me    |

### Example Transformations

- Explain me this rule. → Explain this rule to me.
- Could you explain me the process? → Could you explain the process to me?
- She needs to explain me her decision. → She needs to explain her decision to me.

### Special Note: Word Order in Questions

In the original mistake, there's also a word order issue with the embedded question:

❌ Could you explain me how can I use...  
✓ Could you explain to me how I can use...

In embedded questions (questions within sentences), use statement word order, not question word order:

- I wonder how I can help. (not "how can I help")
- Tell me what you need. (not "what do you need")
- Explain how it works. (not "how does it work")

**Remember:** Always use "explain TO someone" - the preposition "to" is required before the person receiving the explanation.
