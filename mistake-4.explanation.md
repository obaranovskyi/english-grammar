## Additional notes:

In questions with embedded clauses (questions within questions), the word order in the embedded clause should follow statement order, not question order.

**Pattern:** Main question + embedded statement order

**Statement order means:**

- Subject comes before the verb
- No auxiliary verb inversion

**Examples:**

- "I wonder what time it is." (not "what time is it")
- "Please tell me when the store opens." (not "when does the store open")
- "I don't know why she left." (not "why did she leave")
